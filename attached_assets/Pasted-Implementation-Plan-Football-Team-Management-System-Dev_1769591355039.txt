Styling: Tailwind CSS with a high-end design system (Sleek dark mode, pitch green accents)
Database: Shared MongoDB Instance (Same as Registration System)
Backend: Unified Express.js Server (Expanding the current backend to support management features)
Components: Framer Motion for animations, Shadcn/UI for premium components
